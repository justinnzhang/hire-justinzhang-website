# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!
My name is Justin Zhang, a Computer Science and Business student at Western University - graduating in Spring 2023. 
**Actively seeking Product Management and Software Engineering internships for Summer 2022.**

I've always believed in learning through doing and challenging myself to try new things, so here I am!

### ðŸ¤” What is this?
- What started out as an impulse domain purchase turned into my take on the cover letter
- I wanted to showcase my personality and what I believe in beyond the resume
- Hence, [hirejustinzhang.com](https://hirejustinzhang.com) was born!
